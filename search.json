These reads were trimmed using NanoFilt to a length of 1,200-2,000 bases and a quality score threshold of &gt;10. Then, the filtered reads were analysed using Emu with the SILVA-138.1 database, resulting in the identification of number of taxonomic units (NTUs), which are analogous to amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).\n\n\nResult summary\nAll results are organised within the folder Emu, which contains the following subdirectories:\n\nFolder EmuOutputs_Summay: Contains a series of relative abundance .tsv files of all samples, each collapsed at different taxonomic ranks (from phylum to species), generated from the filtered sequences.\nFolder EmuOutputs_Plot: Includes relative abundance plots based on Emu output results, collapsed at different taxonomic ranks (from phylum to species). Reads that could not be assigned a taxonomic classification are labelled as ‘Unknown’ in the plots.\nFolder EmuOutputs_ALL: Contains Emu outputs for each sample, generated from the filtered sequences. These outputs are used to compile the summarised results in the folder EmuOutputs_Summary.\nTables fastq_QC_ RawData_Summary.tsv: A summary table providing a quality check assessment of the raw data reads.\nFolder filtered_read: Contains sequences after the filtering process.\nFolder NanoPlot_FilteredReads_AllSamples_Summary: Includes Nanoplot reports visualising the sequence quality of filtered reads."
